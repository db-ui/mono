</details>
<details>

## Usage

```ts app.module.ts
//app.module.ts
import { DBButtonModule } from '@db-ui/ngx-components';

@NgModule({
	...
		imports: [..., DBButtonModule],
...
})

```

```html app.component.html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<db-button variant="primary">Button</db-button>
```

## Custom Events

We do not provide every event on every component. If you are missing an event please [add an issue](https://github.com/db-ui/mono/issues).

As a workaround you can use refs:

### Ref on component

```html
<DBButton #buttonRef type="button">Test</DBButton>
```

```ts
import { Component, ViewChild, AfterViewInit } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
	selector: "app-my-component",
	templateUrl: "./my-component.component.html"
})
export class MyComponent implements AfterViewInit {
	@ViewChild("buttonRef") buttonRef: any;

	ngAfterViewInit(): void {
		this.buttonRef?.component?.nativeElement?.addEventListener(
			"mouseenter",
			(ev: any) => {
				console.log(ev);
			}
		);
	}
}
```
