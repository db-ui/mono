An Angular library containing all styles & components of [DB UX Design System (technical components)](https://github.com/db-ui/mono).

> **Note:** Find more information about specific components [here](https://db-ui.github.io/mono/review/main)

## Install

```shell
npm i @db-ui/ngx-components
```

> **Note:** This will install [`@db-ui/foundations`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ui/foundations) and [`@db-ui/components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ui/components) as well which contains the `css`/`scss` files

## Styling Dependencies

Import the styles in `scss` or `css`. Based on your technology the file names could be different.

-   Default (relative): points to `../assets`
-   Rollup (rollup): points to `@db-ui/foundations/assets`
-   Webpack (webpack): points to `~@db-ui/foundations/assets`

<details>
  <summary><strong>SCSS</strong></summary>

```scss styles.scss
// styles.scss
@forward "@db-ui/components/build/styles/rollup";
```

</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>CSS</strong></summary>

```css styles.css
/* styles.css */
@import "@db-ui/components/build/styles/rollup.css";
```

</details>

> **Note:** The `relative` file contains optional and all components styles. If you consider performance issues see [@db-ui/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ui/components) for more information.

### Resolve assets

The current default development config in `angular.json` doesn't use output hashing. This may cause an issue loading the fonts. Look at [this](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/26347) for more information.

As a solution add `
"outputHashing": "media"` to `configurations/development` in`angular.json`.

## Usage

```ts app.component.ts
//app.component.ts
import { DBButton } from '@db-ui/ngx-components';

@Component({
	// ...
	imports: [
		// ...,
		DBButton
    ],
	standalone: true
	// ...
})
```

```html app.component.html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<db-button variant="brand">Button</db-button>
```

### Events

There are 3 ways to use Events in Angular:

**[ngModel](https://angular.io/api/forms/NgModel)**

```html
<db-input
	label="Inputfield"
	name="input-name"
	[(ngModel)]="inputModel"
></db-input>
```

**[FormControl](https://angular.io/api/forms/FormControl)**

```html
<db-input
	label="Inputfield"
	name="input-name"
	[formControl]="inputControl"
></db-input>
```

**[change](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event)**

```html
<db-input
	label="Inputfield"
	name="input-name"
	(change)="inputModel = $event.target.value"
></db-input>
```
