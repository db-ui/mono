## Usage

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
	import { DBButton } from "@db-ui/v-components";
</script>

<template>
    <DBButton icon="account" type="button">Test</DBButton>
</template>
```

## Custom Events

We do not provide every event on every component. If you are missing an event please [add an issue](https://github.com/db-ui/mono/issues).

As a workaround you can use refs:

### Ref on component

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { DBButton } from "@db-ui/v-components";

import { ref, onMounted } from "vue";
const buttonRef: any = ref(null);

onMounted(() => {
	buttonRef.value.$refs.component.addEventListener("mouseenter", (ev) => {
		console.log(ev);
	});
});
</script>

<template>
    <DBButton ref="buttonRef" type="button">Test</DBButton>
</template>
```
